Lewis ponders the source of human awe and dread, which are elements of religion. Remember, we're discussing the origin of religion here. Now Lewis is breaking down religion into its various components, and examining them. When he uses these words, he means something different than fear. He defines Numinous, an object which brings about a sense of dread within us. Suppose you believed a mighty spirit were in the room with you. The feeling you felt, that is the awe and dread, and the spirit would be the Numinous. Lewis argues that it is impossible to infer such a feeling from the facts of the universe. Nothing about the natural world would lead man to fear this type of supernatural being; but the feeling comes from man's interpretation of the universe. It is similar to beauty. One could not explain why an object is beautiful to a creature without aesthetic experience, even if he explained all the facts of the object to him. So where does awe come from? Either awe is a random artifact of the human mind, or it is a real experience - a revelation.

There is another feeling that surpasses the facts of the natural world: morality. The feeling of oughtness, like awe, cannot be explained by the physical universe. There's something interesting about morality: even where men differ, they all agree is prescribing a behavior, a correction. Men are aware of breaking the moral law, and of guilt. Religion also has this element, the concept of a moral law both approved of and disobeyed. Men are conscious of this - yet it cannot be explained by facts. We bring it to our own experience.
