Any sort of dynamic visualization really needs this separation, since your users will be loading and filtering new data without refreshing the page. Backbone's data layer is pretty straightforward: models hold objects, and collections hold arrays of models. This fit nicely with D3, as you're typically manipulating arrays of objects. Collections are thus the natural choice for the data layer in Backbone."),Object(n.b)("p",null,"Ember also has models, but instead of collections it uses controllers to store arrays of data. Why the new name? Because controllers actually serve a different purpose than collections. There is little functional difference between models and collections in Backbone - when working with data, sometimes you are working with many blog posts (a collection) and sometimes a single post (a model). Both Backbone objects essentially start out as data stores with some additional functionality, and allow you to add your own properties and methods as you see fit.
